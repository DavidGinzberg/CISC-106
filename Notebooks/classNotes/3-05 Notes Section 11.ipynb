    "    Versions:\n",
    "    0.142 - 2014-APR-23, Modified by Jon Leighton\n",
    "     + Modified success and failure messages to print \"SUCCESS\" and \"FAILURE\" at the\n",
    "       beginning of each result. This makes it much easier to quickly discern the\n",
    "       outcome visually.\n",
    "    0.141 - 2014-MAR-26, Modified by Jon Leighton\n",
    "     + Removed unused function print_verbose().\n",
    "     + Appended text to FAILURE message for incompatible types to indicate that types\n",
    "       involved can't be compared.\n",
    "    0.14 - 2014-MAR-26, Modified by Andrew Roosen\n",
    "     + Modified assertEqual() to return False on failure and True on success.\n",
    "     + Introduced QUITE option to supress output on SUCCESS.\n",
    "     + Modified FAILURE message for incompatible data types to be consistent with\n",
    "     + FAILURE message for unequal values.\n",
    "     + Modified names of internal functions isEqual() and isseqtype() to __isEqual()\n",
    "       and __isseqtype(), respectively\n",
    "    0.13 - 2014-MAR-25, Modified by Jon Leighton\n",
    "     + added elif clause to __isEqual(), to avoid comparing ints and floats to anything\n",
    "       that is not an int or a float, and to return None in this case. The previous\n",
    "       comparison tried to subtract these quantities from each other, causing a\n",
    "       runtime error.\n",
    "     + Modified assertEqual() to check for __isEqual() returning None, which now\n",
    "       indicates an attempt to compare unrelated data types. Failure message is\n",
    "       modified in this case to report the attempt to compare unrelated types.\n",
    "     + Removed unused global variables fail and success.\n",
    "     + Added version numbers to Paul Amer's modifications, and bumped version number to\n",
    "       reflect my modifications.\n",
    "     + Changed version number to string, to match recommended practice.\n",
    "    0.122 - 2012-APR-17, Modified by Paul Amer\n",
    "     + removed graphics stuff; just kept AssertEqual\n",
    "    0.121 - 2011-SEP-08, Modified by Paul Amer\n",
    "     +improved success-failure messages\n",
    "    0.12\n",
    "     + display can be called multiple times\n",
    "     + assertEqual supports PIL.Image.Image\n",
